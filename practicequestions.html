                            <h3>Question One</h3>
                            <p>In a class of 25 students it is found that 6 of the students play both tennis and chess, 10
play tennis only and 3 play neither. A student is selected at random from this group.
Using a Venn diagram, find the probability that the student.</p>
<p>(a) plays both tennis and chess.</p>
<p>(b) plays chess only.</p>
<p>(c) does not play chess.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Question Two</h3>
                            <p>A blue and a red die are rolled together (both numbered one to six).</p>
<P>(a) Draw a lattice diagram that best represents this experiment.</p>
<P>(b) Find the probability of observing an odd number.</p>
<P>(c) Find the probability of observing an even number with the red die.</p>
<P>(d) Find the probability of observing a sum of 7</p>
<P>(e) Find the probability of observing a sum of 7 or an odd number on the red die.</p>
                                
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Question Three</h3>
                            <p>The probability that an animal will still be alive in 12 years is 0.55 and the probability that
its mate will still be alive in 12 years is 0.60.
Find the probability that</p>
<P>(a) both will still be alive in 12 years.</p>
<P>(b) only the mate will still be alive in 12 years.</p>
<P>(c) at least one of them will still be alive in 12 years.</p>
<P>(d) the mate is still alive in 12 years given that only one is still alive in 12 years.</p>
                                
                        </li>
                        
                         <li>
                            <h3>Question Four</h3>
                            <p>A dart board consisting of consecutive circles of radius 1, 2 and 3 units is placed against a
wall. A player throws darts at the board, each dart landing at some random location on the
board. The player will receive $9.00 if the smaller circle is hit, $7.00 if the middle annular
region is hit and $4.00 if the outer annular region is hit. Should players miss the board
altogether, they would lose $k each time. The probability that the player misses the dart
board is 0.5. Find the value of k if the game is to be fair.
