                <h1>An in Depth Look at Probability</h1>
                <p>We are often faced with statements that reflect an element of likelihood, For example, “It is likely
to rain later in the day” or “What are the chances that I roll a six?”. Such statements relate to a
level of uncertainty (or indeed, a level of certainty). It is this element of likelihood in which we
are interested. In particular, we need to find a measure of this likelihood — i.e., the associated
probability of particular events.</p>

                    <img src="./img4.png">
                    <p>From the tree diagram we have a sample space made up of eight possible outcomes:
{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}</p>
                     <p>(a) Let X be the event “Obtaining three tails.”, so X = {TTT}. Therefore P(x) = 1&frasl;8.</p>
                     <p>(b) Although we can answer this question by using the tree diagram, we make use of
 complementary events to solve this problem.
Notice that “At least one head.” is the complement of no heads.
Therefore, p(At least one head) = P(x) = 1 - 1&frasl;8 = 7&frasl;8 </p>

                    <p>If a random experiment is repeated N times, in such a way that each of the trials is identical and independent, where n(A)is the number of times event A has occured after N trials, then As N → ∞, n(A) / N → P(A)</p>

                     <h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
                  
                    <p>If A and B are two events, then the conditional probability of event A given event B is
found using: P(A|B) =  P(A∩B)&frasl;P(B), P(B) does not equal 0</p>
                    <p>If A and B are mutually exclusive then P(A|B) = 0.
 From the above rule, we also have the general Multiplication rule: P(A∩B) = P(A|B)xP(B)</p>
                    <p>Usually P(A|B) does not equal P(B|A)</p>
                    <p>Prob(E1∪E2) = Prob(E1) + Prob(E2) − Prob(E1∩E2)</p>
                    <p>this reduces to the earlier rule
Prob(E1∪E2) = Prob(E1) + Prob(E2) for disjoint E1,E2</p>
                    <p>Independent Events: Prob(E1∩E2) = Prob(E1)· Prob(E2)</p>
